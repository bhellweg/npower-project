This Shiny web app provides a snapshot into NPower Maryland's alumni body and helps showcase the equitable recruitment of NPower students throughout Maryland. The map allows you to see how their places of residence compare to Maryland as a whole in terms of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, and the charts provide detail into the status of the program over time.
